# !!! KEEP IN MIND this is in a PUBLIC REPO
# permissions: {} # won't block read access to anything that the public can already see (i.e. workflows/actions/pulls/issues/etc)
#    TLDR in PUBLIC REPOS, permissions are for selectively granting write access
#    TLDR in PRIVATE REPOS, permissions are meaningful for all values (none/read/write)
#       and restrictive default (contents: read, metadata: read, packages: read) means you can't do much with the GH CLI for example.
