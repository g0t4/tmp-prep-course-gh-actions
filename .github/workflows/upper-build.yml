        #   IDEA => show executable downloaded (from uploaded linux binary) doesn't work on macos => download it and try to run it... "file could not be run by the operating system." => ok, lets build on a mac instead then too
        # PRN pivot to GOOS/GOARCH to cross compile: https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment, i.e.:
        #  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o upper-linux main.go
        #  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o upper-windows.exe main.go
        #  GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o upper-darwin main.go
        #  why? one, simple ubuntu runner can handle all of them (even arch)... much less complexity
